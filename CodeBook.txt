Version 1.0
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
STUDY DESIGN:


Source data and information regarding the file structures can be obtained at this URL:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Datasets used:

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. 
	Its range is from 1 to 30.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels. 

- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. 
	Its range is from 1 to 30.

For additional information on these files, including License information, refer to the source data README file.


Variable selection:
Train and Test datasets were collated and combined with subject identifiers and activity labels. 
The combined data restricted to measures of the mean value (mean) and standard deviation (std).
All features present in the raw data were considered for inclusion in the analysis dataset.

Derivations:
The final dataset includes the mean value of each of the selected raw variables grouping by subject and activity.

CODE BOOK:
1. Activity: Coded value identifying the activity being performed.
	1 .Walking 
	2 .Walking Upstairs
	3 .Walking Downstairs
	4 .Sitting
	5 .Standing
	6 .Lying Down

2. ActivityName: Character value naming the activity being performed. These correspond to Activity.


3. Subject: Numeric subject ID ranging from 1-30.


The remaining variables follow the naming convention [feature name][summary measure][.axis] where

"feature name" is the feature measured (as described in the source data) and include:
	tBodyAcc
	tGravityAcc
	tBodyAccJerk
	tBodyGyro
	tBodyGyroJerk
	tBodyAccMag
	tGravityAccMag
	tBodyAccJerkMag
	tBodyGyroMag
	tBodyGyroJerkMag
	fBodyAcc
	fBodyAccJerk
	fBodyGyro
	fBodyAccMag
	fBodyAccJerkMag
	fBodyGyroMag
	fBodyGyroJerkMag
  Note: 
	t=Time, f=Frequency. 
	Acc=Acceleration and is in standard gravity units (g). 
	Gyro=angular velocity as measured by the gyroscope and is in normalized units of radians/second.
	All features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
	More information on these measurements can be found with the source data.

"summary measure" is either "mean" for the mean value of the signals or "std" for the standard deviation of the signals,

".axis" is an optional suffix to denote which of the 3-axial signals (X, Y, or Z directions) is measured.
Each of these variables contains the mean value across all observations for a given Subject and Activity.
